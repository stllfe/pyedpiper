# Pyedpiper
It's a small (or not really) ML-training and evaluating pipeline built upon pytorch-ignite.
Key aspects that I want to address here are flexibility and extendability. 

I hate touching any 'framework-related' code every time I switch some tiny bits of my model or the process itself during researches at work.
Sometimes you want things to be just plug and play. Or at least I do.

Pyedpiper is purely custom WIP "please don't judge me" type of project. So yeah, let me flex my architecture muscles!
